I am a data scientist specializing in AI, NLP, and computer vision. My current role at McGill University focuses on building an AI assistant for <a href="https://geobon.org/" target="_blank">GEO BON</a>, a global network of 3,500+ biodiversity researchers spanning 152 countries and 2,000 organizations. This RAG-powered agent leverages open-source LLMs such as Llama and DeepSeek, offering capabilities ranging from coding and application interactions to statistical data analysis, delivering reference-backed, reliable, and actionable solutions.  

Previously, at the <a href="https://interactive-or.com/" target="_blank">Interactive-OR Lab</a>, I applied computer vision on edge devices to tackle urban mobility challenges. Before that, I worked as a data analyst at Canadian Tire and collaborated with the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) as a machine learning consultant to enhance AI-driven transit solutions. I hold a master's degree from Toronto Metropolitan University, where I was part of the <a href="https://ls3.rnet.torontomu.ca/" target="_blank">Laboratory for Systems, Software and Semantics</a>, developing a recommendation system for question-answering platforms like Stack Overflow.

## Interests  
I’m passionate about using AI to solve real-world challenges, particularly in NLP and computer vision. I’m also eager to explore emerging areas of machine learning, from healthcare and finance to autonomous systems.
