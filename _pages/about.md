I’m a data scientist specializing in AI, NLP, and computer vision. Currently, I work on the AML (Anti-Money Laundering) team at **TD Bank**.

Previously, I was an AI Engineer at **McGill University**, where I built **BONsAI**, an AI agent for <a href="https://geobon.org/" target="_blank">GEO BON</a> — a global network of over 3,500 biodiversity researchers across 152 countries and 2,000 organizations. BONsAI is a RAG-powered assistant that uses open-source LLMs like Llama and DeepSeek to support experts through coding, app interactions, statistical analysis, and reliable, reference-backed insights.

Before that, at the <a href="https://interactive-or.com/" target="_blank">Interactive-OR Lab</a>, I worked on deploying computer vision models on edge devices to address urban mobility problems. I also held a data analyst role at **Canadian Tire** and collaborated with the **Toronto Transit Commission (TTC)** as a machine learning consultant, helping advance AI-driven transit solutions.

I hold a master’s degree from **Toronto Metropolitan University**, where I was part of the <a href="https://ls3.rnet.torontomu.ca/" target="_blank">Laboratory for Systems, Software and Semantics</a>. My research focused on building a recommendation system for question-answering platforms like Stack Overflow.

## Interests  
I’m passionate about applying AI to real-world challenges, especially in natural language processing and computer vision. I’m also curious about emerging areas of machine learning, with growing interest in applications across healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems.
