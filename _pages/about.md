Welcome to my academic portfolio! I am a passionate and dedicated researcher currently researching at York University. My academic journey reflects a keen interest in machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. As a fast learner and a dependable team player, I am driven to explore innovative applications of machine learning in areas that impact humans' lives.

I am currently focusing on addressing urban problems with AI solutions such as computer vision and graph neural networks. Formerly, I have worked at Canadian Tire as a business analyst. Moreover, I have obtained my master's from Toronto Metropolitan University during which I was part of the <a href="[https://ls3.rnet.ryerson.ca/](https://ls3.rnet.torontomu.ca/)" target="_blank">Labs for Systems, Software and Semantics</a>. Also, I consulted TTC as an academic researcher to achieve their project goals. You can find my latest list of projects [here](projects.md).
