I am a passionate researcher deeply immersed in the realms of machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. My current role as a data scientist, computer vision engineer at York University allows me to channel this enthusiasm into meaningful contributions. My motivation lies in exploring novel applications of machine learning that significantly impact human lives.

My current research focus at <a href="https://interactive-or.com/" target="_blank">Interactive-OR Lab</a> revolves around tackling urban mobility challenges through AI-powered solutions, employing technologies such as computer vision and graph neural networks. Prior to my current position, I held a role as a data analyst at Canadian Tire. Additionally, I completed my master's degree at Toronto Metropolitan University, where I was an active member of the <a href="https://ls3.rnet.torontomu.ca/" target="_blank">Laboratory for Systems, Software and Semantics</a>. During this period, I also collaborated with the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) as a machine learning engineer, contributing to the enhancement of their machine learning products. For an updated list of my latest projects, please refer to [this link](projects).

## Interests
My passion lies in harnessing the potentials of machine learning and AI to break barriers and tackle previously insurmountable challenges. I am dedicated to delving into the profound applications of AI in critical real-world domains, including robotics, autonomous driving, and healthcare. From my experiences, I have been particularly captivated by the realms of computer vision and natural language processing (NLP). However, my eagerness to learn and explore extends beyond these domains, as I am enthusiastic about diving into various other facets of machine learning.
